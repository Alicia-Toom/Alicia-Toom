### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github Profile

I am a student at TeknikhÃ¶gskolan (until May 2023) in Gothenburg, Sweden, studying to become a Python developer with a focus on AI/Machine learning and Deep learning. I have gained hands-on experience through an internship with Zenseact, an autonomous driving company, and I also volunteer as a code mentor at Pink Programming, a non-profit organization.

I have a strong skill set in Agile software development, and I am a quick learner who is able to adapt to new teams. I am fluent in Swedish, English, Thai, Cambodia, and Lao, and I am passionate about learning and helping others. With a start-up mindset and a focus on data-driven decision making, I am eager to continue advancing my skills in the field of machine learning and deep learning.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on helping Zenseact to analyst their internal monitoring system using AIOps approch.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
      - deel pearning
      - computer vision
      - TinyML
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate:
        - AIOps projects, Machine Learning applications in the field of monitoring and analysis
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: 
        - Optimizing my deep learning models for real-time analysis
        - Exploring new techniques for analysis and visualization of monitoring data
